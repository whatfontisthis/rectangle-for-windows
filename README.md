# Rectangle for Windows

This is my attempt at building a Windows equivalent of Mac's window management app, Rectangle.

## Features:
- **Snap**: Snaps windows to the left, right, top, or bottom of the screen.
- **Adjustment**: Allows resizing of windows.
- **Multi-Monitor Support**: Enables moving windows to the next monitor.

## Issues to Fix:
- **Snap**: Windows are not snapping to exactly half of the screen.
- **Adjustment**: Based on the snap position, resizing should only grow horizontally or vertically. This feature needs fixing.
- **Multi-Monitor**: Errors occur when moving windows to another monitor.
